# Port-Scanning-with-Zenmap
I developed a port scanning project utilizing Zenmap. Zenmap or a nmap (Network Mapper) tool, is an open-source tool that allows administrators to learn whether the device is turned on, which services are running on the open ports, and which operating system the device is using by sending packets to the device and ports of the device on the network to view its responses. (Picture Included).
